  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Freshen up your chicken dinner recipe rotation with bright, creamy Lemon Chicken Piccata. This keto friendly, classic dish is made with Primal Kitchen Dijon Mustard, garlic, and lemon for a vibrant and savory mix of flavor and texture. Succulent chicken meets herbaceous thyme and piquant mustard and capers for an elegant, quick meal any day of the week.</p>

  <p>For more sauce, you can use more chicken broth. To thicken the broth, add additional tapioca starch, about half a teaspoon at a time until the sauce reaches your desired thickness.

Making the slurry helps prevent any clumps in your sauce.

Thin sliced breasts cook quickly and are perfect for pan frying. You can use thicker pieces of chicken breasts, but expect to finish cooking the chicken in the oven if you use them.

Depending on how salty your broth is, you may need to add more salt to the sauce as it’s cooking. Don’t be afraid to season to taste!</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>4 thin sliced chicken breasts (about 1.25 lbs.)</li>
      <li>3 tbsp. tapioca starch</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp. salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon McCormick® Garlic Powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon McCormick® Perfect Pinch® Italian Seasoning</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon McCormick® Parsley Flakes</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon McCormick® Pure Ground Black Pepper</li>
      <li>1 jar (26 ounces) marinara or other pasta sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 cup water</li>
      <li>9 uncooked lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a dish or shallow bowl, toss the chicken breasts in 2.5 tbsp. tapioca starch, the salt, black pepper and garlic powder.</li>
      <li>Heat the butter in a stainless or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Once the butter is melted and bubbling, add the chicken breasts.</li>
      <li>Brown the chicken breasts for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until cooked through.</li>
      <li>Remove the chicken breasts from the pan and set them aside. Lower the temperature of the heat to medium heat and add the broth to the pan.</li>
      <li>Use a whisk to bring up any browned bits off the bottom of the pan. Scoop out a few tablespoons of liquid and mix it with the remaining tapioca starch to create a slurry.</li>
      <li>As the liquid in the pan begins to bubble, add the fresh thyme and mustard. Allow the mixture to simmer until it starts to thicken slightly, then add the slurry to the pan.</li>
      <li>Whisk until the mixture reaches the thickness of your liking, then add the capers and lemon juice.</li>
      <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Place the cooked chicken back into the pan and coat the chicken in the sauce.</li>
      <li>Add the lemon slices to the pan and top with more fresh thyme. Serve with your favorite side dish.</li>
